Instructions
============

This plugin is to be placed in the reports directory in a Moodle 2.7 environment, and named "assignmentactivity".

On my mac machine, this path is:
/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/moodle27/report/assignmentactivity


Function
========

This plugin allows a course admin to select an assignment and view the relative submission times of all students who made a submission for that assignment.

This graphical visualization of submission times allows a teacher to notice patterns in student submission, such as if many students submit late.  The scale of the visualization is based upon the release date of the assignment and the due date of the assignment.
